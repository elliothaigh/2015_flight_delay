Analysis of 2015 flight delay data in the US 2015

## Context 
Tens of millions of flight disruptions occur each year around the world causing travel chaos for passengers and significant financial losses for airlines and airports. By analyzing a dataset of flight delays and cancelations from 2015 in the United States I will gain insight into the patterns and causes of these delays and seek to understand how their negative impact can be reduced in the future.

This dataset was chosen as it not only fulfills the briefing specifications but also appeals to my interest in working with travel data. Having traveled quite extensively myself I have experienced a number of disruptions over the years and to analyze the cause of these delays and try to mitigate them as best as possible is a goal of every airline around the world. 

## Data Sourcing
The flight delay and cancellation data were collected and published by the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

## Data Collection
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

## Data Contents
The dataset contains many details about each of the 5.8 million flights that suffered from delays or cancelations in the US in 2015. The full list of variables is listed below in the data profile however among them are the location of their departure and arrival, expected and actual take-off and landing times as well as the attributed reason for the cancelation or delay.
